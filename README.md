This is a simple web application that displays random quotes each time the user clicks a button.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the index.html file in your web browser.
3. Click the "New Quote" button to display a new quote.

## Design

The design of this application is minimalist and straightforward. The main focus is on the quote displayed in the center of the page, with a simple background color and font to provide contrast.

## Code Overview

The main functionality of the Random Quote Machine is implemented in JavaScript. The quotes are stored in an array, and a random quote is selected each time the "New Quote" button is clicked. The quote is then displayed on the page using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

The CSS is used to style the layout and appearance of the page, while the HTML provides the structure.
